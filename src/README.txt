1. Please set the text and background colors of terminal to "system colors" before running the application.
    Edit -> Profile Preferences -> Colors -> tick on "Use colors from system them"

   This would turn the background to white and text to black, which is most suitable for the colors
   used in the application.

2. Spaces can occur in file/directory names. THe user should use '\' character before the space to
   include it in the name.
   E.g.: my\ file\ name.txt   --> is a single file with spaces in its name.

3. Left-Right arrow keys and Backspace key can be used, in command mode, to edit the typed command.

4. Pressing ESC in normal mode will ask the user to confirm termination of the application.

5. In command mode, the error displayed on the status bar (in case some anomaly occurs) will be removed automatically
   on the next key input by the user.

6. Try to reach above the root directory will result in going to the root directory.
  E.g. Doing "goto ~/../../../" will result in going to the root directory.

7. If error messages are displayed on the terminal on opening a file in normal mode,
    please press left arrow key followed by right arrow key to come back to the same directory.
